# Ideas

## Syntax
- Every expression is a line, no multiline (+)
- Variable assignment when first word on line is `var` (+)
- A symbol `#` for comments, those lines starting with that symbol gets ignored by the interpreter (+)
- Mathematical functions have the syntax `func()`
- Replace custom function names with sympy ones. (eg. ) 
- parse_expr when? when saving variable 
- save statement: `save filename append/overwrite`
- non character values is not allowed -> _,./-+()&%¤#"@£${[]}\?
